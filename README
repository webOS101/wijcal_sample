Enyo wrapping for Wijmo's calendar widget.  For more info visit http://wijmo.com/
Calendar documentation is available at: http://wijmo.com/wiki/index.php/Calendar
Most calendar events are wrapped as Enyo events, with the exception of the title
event. To implement the title callback, set the title property to a function that
returns a string. It is also possible to set the title to string.
